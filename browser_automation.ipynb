    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation is used to programmatically interact with web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its primary use is to test websites (internally) by simulating user behavior (mouse clicks, scrolling, etc), but it can also be used for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation isn’t always the best situation for building a dataset, but it is necessary when you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scrape rendered HTML**: browser automation lets you see what's on a website as a user would.\n",
    "1. **Simulate user behavior**: comes in handy when you want to experiment with personalization.\n",
    "1. **Wait for scripts and code to execute**: let's you retrieve information that requires a code to run behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular browser automation tools are [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/). \n",
    "\n",

    "In the investigation “[Google the Giant](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors),” The Markup wanted to measure how much a Google Search page is “Google.” Aside from the daunting task of classifying what is Google and what isn’t, the team of two investigative journalists; Adrianne Jeffries and Leon Yin (a co-author of this section) needed to measure real estate on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team developed a [targeted staining technique](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/how-we-analyzed-google-search-results-web-assay-parsing-tool) inspired by the life sciences called an assay– commonly used to highlight the presence of chemicals, compounds, or cancers. \n",

    "The reporters created over [68 web parsers](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-google-search-audit/blob/master/utils/parsers.py) to identify each element on a web page that was Google, along with three other categories. Once an element was identified, they could find the coordinates of each element along with its corresponding bounding box. Using the categorization and bounding box, reporters could see how many pixels were allocated to Google properties, as well as where they were placed on a page.\n",

    "### Results\n",
    "The figure above shows the frequency of the appearance of target videos during our 100-videos-long session. You can verify in the folder where this notebook is located if the videos we watched were really food related because of the screenshots we saved. If the feed was indeed increasingly filled with food videos, we would see more an more lines towards the right of the graph. At least here it does not appear to be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does it mean that the WSJ audit was wrong or that TikTok stopped personalizing content? No, for a number of reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We only scrolled through 100 videos, this is likely too few to observe any effects. Try re-running with a higher number!\n",
    "1. When studying personalization you should use an account per profile and make sure you're logged in, rather than relying on a fresh browser. So, instead of closing the login dialog, try actually logging in! You know how to find and click buttons, and [this is how you put text in text fields](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send_keys-element-method-selenium-python/).\n",
    "1. When you're not logged in, you will be presented with content from all over the world, in all languages. If your filters keywords in one language only, you will miss plenty of target content in other languages.\n",
    "1. You should always have a baseline to compare to. In this case, you should probably run two accounts at the same time - one that watches food videos and one that doesn't. Then you compare the prevalence of food videos between these two.\n",
    "1. The WSJ audit was run on the mobile app rathern than on a desktop browser. Perhaps personalization works differently depending on which platform you're running your study."
