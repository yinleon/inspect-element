    "\n",
    "Browser automation is used to programmatically interact with web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its primary use is to test websites (internally) by simulating user behavior (mouse clicks, scrolling, etc), but it can also be used for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation isn‚Äôt always the best situation for building a dataset, but it is necessary when you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scrape rendered HTML**: browser automation lets you see what's on a website as a user would.\n",
    "1. **Simulate user behavior**: comes in handy when you want to experiment with personalization.\n",
    "1. **Wait for scripts and code to execute**: let's you retrieve information that requires a code to run behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular browser automation tools are [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/). \n",

Once an element was identified, they could find the coordinates of each element along with its corresponding bounding box. Using the categorization and bounding box, reporters could see how many pixels were allocated to Google properties, as well as where they were placed on a page.\n",
