    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve tried to buy concert tickets to a popular act lately, you’ve probably watched in horror as the blue “available” seats evaporate before your eyes the instant tickets are released. Part of that may be pure star-power, but more than likely, it’s also because bots were programmed to buy tickets to be resold at a premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "These bots are programmed to act like an eager fan: waiting in the queue, selecting a seat, and paying for the show. These tasks can all be executed using browser automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Browser automation** is used to programmatically interact with web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent use case for browser automation is to run tests on websites by simulating user behavior (mouse clicks, scrolling, etc). This is routine and invisible work that you wouldn’t remember, unlike, for example, seeing your dream of crowd surfing with your favorite musician disappear thanks to ticket-buying bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "But browser automation has another use, one which _may_ make your dreams come true: web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation isn’t always the best situation for building a dataset, but it is necessary when you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scrape rendered HTML**: browser automation lets you see what's on a website as a user would.\n",
    "2. **Simulate user behavior**: comes in handy when you want to experiment with personalization.\n",
    "3. **Trigger event execution**: retrieve responses to JavaScript or [network requests]() following an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reasons are often interrelated, but we will highlight case studies (below) that demonstrate the importance of each individual reason and why it was a necessary choice for an investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular browser automation tools are [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Headless Browsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation can be executed in a \"headless\" state by some tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that the browser is a ghost or anything like that, it just means that the _user interface_ is not used. Instead, everything happens behind the scenes as if the user interface _was_ used.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of headless browsing is that it is less [resource intensive](/apis.html#case-study-on-scalability-collecting-internet-plans), however there is no visibility into what the browser is doing. This makes any web scraper you build more difficult to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, some browser automation tools (such as Selenium) allow you to toggle headless browsing on and off. Other tools, such as Puppeteer only allow you to use headless browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to browser automation, we suggest not using headless browsing off the bat. We suggest you try Selenium, which is exactly what we’ll do in the tutorial below."

    "In the investigation “[Google the Giant](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors),” The Markup wanted to measure how much a Google Search page is “Google.” Aside from the daunting task of classifying what is \"Google,\" and what is \"not Google,\" the team of two investigative journalists-- Adrianne Jeffries and Leon Yin (a co-author of this section) needed to measure real estate on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team developed a [targeted staining technique](https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/how-we-analyzed-google-search-results-web-assay-parsing-tool) inspired by the life sciences, originally used to highlight the presence of chemicals, compounds, or cancers. \n",

Once an element was identified, they could find the coordinates of each element along with its corresponding bounding box.

    "## Case Study 2: Deanonymizing Google's Ad Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad sellers offer space on websites or apps to show advertisements, and are compensated by Google whenever an ad is shown. Over two-thirds of the 1.3 million ad sellers on Google are anonymous. What makes this even less transparent is that multiple websites and apps can be monetized by the same seller, and it’s also not clear which websites are a part of Google’s ad network. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that [advertisers](https://checkmyads.org/branded/google-ads-has-become-a-massive-dark-money-operation/) and the public do not know who is making money from Google’s ad network. Fortunately, watchdog groups (such as Check My Ads), industry analysts, and reporters have developed methods to hold Google accountable for this oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that an ad seller is part of Google’s ad network and to link sellers to websites, wait for the site to send Google a request for an ad to be shown on the website. This process reveals their unique seller ID, which shows the seller is authorized to serve ads and monetize the space on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, reporters from ProPublica used PlayWright to [automate this process](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-display-ads-piracy-porn-fraud) to visit 7 million websites to match web domains to seller IDs. They were able to deanonymize over 900,000 Google ad sellers and show that their websites were able to monetize despite breaking Google’s policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For their investigation, the reporters had to wait for ads to be shown, which requires the page to be loaded, and in some cases, requires scrolling to potential ad space. This is a unique function of browser automation tools, allowing ProPublica to **trigger event execution** in the browser and cause the ads to be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reporters used a combination of network requests, rendered HTML, as well as cross-referencing screenshots to confirm that each website monetized ads from Google’s ad network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation can help you trawl for clues, especially when it comes to looking for specific network requests sent to a central player by many different websites.\n"

    "You can look back to the `data/screenshots` folder we created to check whether the videos we watched appear to be food-related. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the feed was indeed increasingly filled with food videos, we would see more lines towards the right of the graph. At least here it does not appear to be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does it mean that the WSJ investigation was wrong, or that TikTok stopped personalizing content? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"No,\" for several reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We only scrolled through 100 videos, this is likely too few to observe any effects. Try re-running with a higher number!<br>\n",
    "2. When studying personalization you should use an account per profile and make sure you're logged in, rather than relying on a fresh browser. So, instead of closing the login dialog, try actually logging in! You know how to find and click buttons, and [this is how you put text in text fields](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send_keys-element-method-selenium-python/).<br>\n",
    "3. When you're not logged in, you will be presented with content from all over the world, in all languages. If you filtered `keywords` in just one language, you will miss plenty of target content in other languages.<br>\n",
    "4. You should always have a baseline to compare to. In this case, you should probably run two accounts at the same time - one that watches food videos and one that doesn't. Then you compare the prevalence of food videos between these two.<br>\n",
    "5. The WSJ investigation was run on the mobile app rather than on a desktop browser. Perhaps TikTok's personalization works differently based on device or operating system."
