    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve tried to buy concert tickets to a popular act lately, you’ve probably watched in horror as the blue “available” seats evaporate before your eyes the instant tickets are released. Part of that may be pure star-power, but more than likely, it’s also because bots were programmed to buy tickets to be resold at a premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "These bots are programmed to act like an eager fan: waiting in the queue, selecting a seat, and paying for the show. These tasks can all be executed using browser automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Browser automation** is used to programmatically interact with web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent use case for browser automation is to run tests on websites by simulating user behavior (mouse clicks, scrolling, etc). This is routine and invisible work that you wouldn’t remember, unlike, for example, seeing your dream of crowd surfing with your favorite musician disappear thanks to ticket-buying bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "But browser automation has another use, one which _may_ make your dreams come true: web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation isn’t always the best situation for building a dataset, but it is necessary when you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scrape rendered HTML**: browser automation lets you see what's on a website as a user would.\n",
    "2. **Simulate user behavior**: comes in handy when you want to experiment with personalization.\n",
    "3. **Trigger event execution**: retrieve responses to JavaScript or [network requests]() following an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reasons are often interrelated, but we will highlight case studies (below) that demonstrate the importance of each individual reason and why it was a necessary choice for an investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular browser automation tools are [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Headless Browsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation can be executed in a \"headless\" state by some tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that the browser is a ghost or anything like that, it just means that the _user interface_ is not used. Instead, everything happens behind the scenes as if the user interface _was_ used.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of headless browsing is that it is less [resource intensive](/apis.html#case-study-on-scalability-collecting-internet-plans), however there is no visibility into what the browser is doing. This makes any web scraper you build a bit more difficult to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, some browser automation tools (such as Selenium) allow you to toggle headless browsing on and off. Other tools, such as Puppeteer only allow you to use headless browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to browser automation, we suggest not using headless browsing off the bat. We suggest you try Selenium, which is exactly what we’ll do in the tutorial below."

    "\n",
    "Most of these recordings go unnoticed by visitors, and in some cases the website you're on doesn't even know that they are tracking you on behalf of another company.\n",

Third-party trackers leave clues behind in network requests that [trigger as your use the site](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites), as well as small clues that are executed when you load the page, such as drawing [cool abstract art](https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#canvas-fingerprinting) and noticing minor differences in how shapes are rendered.\n",

    "\n",
    "Browser automation can help you trawl for clues, especially when it comes to looking for specific network requests sent to a central player by many different websites. This is the same reason that reporters at [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-display-ads-piracy-porn-fraud) used the browser automation tool Playwright to de-anonymize roughly over 900,000 [Google ad buyers](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-ads-misinformation-methodology) across millions of websites online."

    "### Results\n",
    "The figure above shows the frequency of the appearance of target videos during our 100-videos-long session. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can look back to the `data/screenshots` folder we created to check whether the videos we watched appear to be food-related. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the feed was indeed increasingly filled with food videos, we would see more lines towards the right of the graph. At least here it does not appear to be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does it mean that the WSJ investigation was wrong, or that TikTok stopped personalizing content? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"No,\" for several reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We only scrolled through 100 videos, this is likely too few to observe any effects. Try re-running with a higher number!<br>\n",
    "2. When studying personalization you should use an account per profile and make sure you're logged in, rather than relying on a fresh browser. So, instead of closing the login dialog, try actually logging in! You know how to find and click buttons, and [this is how you put text in text fields](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send_keys-element-method-selenium-python/).<br>\n",
    "3. When you're not logged in, you will be presented with content from all over the world, in all languages. If you filtered `keywords` in just one language, you will miss plenty of target content in other languages.<br>\n",
    "4. You should always have a baseline to compare to. In this case, you should probably run two accounts at the same time - one that watches food videos and one that doesn't. Then you compare the prevalence of food videos between these two.<br>\n",
    "5. The WSJ investigation was run on the mobile app rather than on a desktop browser. Perhaps TikTok's personalization works differently based on device or operating system."
