    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve tried to buy concert tickets to a popular act lately, you’ve probably watched in horror as the blue “available” seats evaporate before your eyes the instant tickets are released. Part of that may be pure ✨star-power✨, but more than likely, it’s also because bots were programmed to buy tickets to be resold at a premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "These bots are programmed to act like an eager fan: waiting in the queue, selecting a seat, and paying for the show. These tasks can all be executed using browser automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Browser automation** is used to programmatically interact with web applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent use case for browser automation is to run tests on websites by simulating user behavior (mouse clicks, scrolling, and filling out forms). This is routine and invisible work that you wouldn’t remember, unlike seeing your dream of crowd surfing with your favorite musician disappear thanks to ticket-buying bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "But browser automation has another use, one which _may_ make your dreams come true: web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation isn’t always the best situation for building a dataset, but it is necessary when you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze rendered HTML**: see what's on a website as a user would.\n",
    "2. **Simulate user behavior**: experiment with personalization and experience a website as a user would.\n",
    "3. **Trigger event execution**: retrieve responses to JavaScript or [network requests](/apis.html) following an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reasons are often interrelated, but we will highlight case studies (below) that demonstrate each strength and why browser automation was a necessary choice for past investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular browser automation tools are [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Headless Browsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation can be executed in a \"headless\" state by some tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that the browser is a ghost or anything like that, it just means that the _user interface_ is not visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of headless browsing is that it is less [resource intensive](/apis.html#case-study-on-scalability-collecting-internet-plans), however there is no visibility into what the browser is doing, making headless scrapers difficult to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, some browser automation tools (such as Selenium) allow you to [toggle headless browsing](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/headless-is-going-away/) on and off. Other tools, such as Puppeteer only allow you to use headless browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to browser automation, we suggest not using headless browsing off the bat. We suggest you try Selenium, which is exactly what we’ll do in the [tutorial](#tutorial) below."

    "## Case Study 2: Deanonymizing Google's Ad Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Google ad sellers offer space on websites like virtual billboards, and are compensated by Google after an ad is shown. However, unlike physical ad sellers, almost all of the ~1.3 million ad sellers on Google are anonymous. To limit transparency further, multiple websites and apps can be monetized by the same seller, and it’s not clear which websites are part of Google’s ad network in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, [advertisers](https://checkmyads.org/branded/google-ads-has-become-a-massive-dark-money-operation/) and the public do not know who is making money from Google ads. Fortunately, watchdog groups, industry analysts, and reporters have developed methods to hold Google accountable for this oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods boil down to triggering a JavaScript function that sends a request to Google to show an ad on a loaded web page. Importantly, the request reveals the seller ID used to monetize the website displaying the ad, and in doing so, links the seller ID to the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, reporters from ProPublica used Playwrite to [automated this process](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-display-ads-piracy-porn-fraud) to visit 7 million websites and deanonymize over 900,000 Google ad sellers. Their investigation found some websites were able to monetize advertisements, despite breaking Google’s policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "ProPublica's investigation used browser automation tools to **trigger event execution** to successfully load ads. Often, this required waiting a page to fully render, scrolling down to potential ad space, and browsing multiple pages. The reporters used a combination of network requests, rendered HTML, and cross-referencing screenshots to confirm that each website monetized ads from Google’s ad network.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can look back to the `data/screenshots` folder we created to check whether the videos we watched appear to be food-related. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the feed was indeed increasingly filled with food videos, we would see more lines towards the right of the graph. At least here it does not appear to be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does it mean that the WSJ investigation was wrong, or that TikTok stopped personalizing content? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"No,\" for several reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We only scrolled through 100 videos, this is likely too few to observe any effects. Try re-running with a higher number!<br>\n",
    "2. When studying personalization you should use an account per profile and make sure you're logged in, rather than relying on a fresh browser. So, instead of closing the login dialog, try actually logging in! You know how to find and click buttons, and [this is how you put text in text fields](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send_keys-element-method-selenium-python/).<br>\n",
    "3. When you're not logged in, you will be presented with content from all over the world, in all languages. If you filtered `keywords` in just one language, you will miss plenty of target content in other languages.<br>\n",
    "4. You should always have a baseline to compare to. In this case, you should probably run two accounts at the same time - one that watches food videos and one that doesn't. Then you compare the prevalence of food videos between these two.<br>\n",
    "5. The WSJ investigation was run on the mobile app rather than on a desktop browser. Perhaps TikTok's personalization works differently based on device or operating system."
