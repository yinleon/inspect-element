    "**1. What is the hypothesis of the story?**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_This is a testable claim that can be proven or disproven. The hypothesis is revised and honed in the early stages of an investigation._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Who is being harmed and at what scale?**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_Give us a sense of who is being harmed, and whether outcomes are proportionate?_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Who is causing the harm and what is the accountability angle?**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_What frameworks exist– legal, company policies, sworn testimonies, to hold them accountable?_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is the evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) you’ve gathered that leads you to think you have a viable hypothesis?**\n",

    "_If there is existing work on this topic (journalistic, academic, lived experience) how will you build off that work?_\n",
    "\n",

    "_How can you begin to collect and analyze data as a proof of concept?_\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. What data will you need to run an analysis? How will you gather the data?**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_Web scraping, public records requests, using open data? How will you decide what makes up your sample? Specificity is your friend._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. How complicated is the data collection?**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_Will you be able to do this alone? Do you need to use proxies, cloud instances? Do you need to collect data over time?_\n",

    "**9. What are the limitations of the dataset(s) you are proposing to use? How will you test its accuracy?**\n",

    "\n",

    "**10. Do you need to classify the data for your experiment? If so, please describe how you propose doing that. Are there outside classifications or experts you can lean on? What are the limitations of your classification method?**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_Seldom is the outcome you want to measure already encoded in a column. Instead, you need to make that assessment._\n",

    "_Start with simplicity._\n",

    "_Use this space to brainstorm how you’ll frame your findings. This helps make your findings tangible. I use TK’s at this step._\n",
