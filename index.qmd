As reporters and researchers we ask fundamental questions of how titans of industry, government institutions and the powerful impact society. Puzzle pieces to the answers we seek are all too often scattered, intermingled, or sealed away. Increasingly, the affordances of technology can be used to collate disparate data sources to unearth evidence of harm at scale.

This guide walks through in-depth case studies and hands-on tutorials to help you investigate opaque systems, systematically.

You will learn how to build your own datasets by [finding undocumented APIs](/apis.html), [automating  browsers](/browser_automation.html), and crowdsourcing evidence. Most importantly, you'll build the intution to develop and test [hypotheses](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&id=p::usmarcdef_0000193078&file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_ba5365b5-bd0c-4bb9-a008-3e0935174cbe%3F_%3D193078eng.pdf&locale=en&multi=true&ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000193078/PDF/193078eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A76%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D), and bullet-proof methodologies to answer questions for your reporting and research.

As practitioners, we've had to learn on the job, hit dead ends, and seek external expertise across fields and industries. Here we distill these experiences and include tips for veterans and new-comers alike.

The disciplines we'll draw from include: investigative journalism, data engineering, computer science, social science, and other branches of information science.

Don't code? No problem: the guide emphasizes underlying principles and uses plain-language ("pseudocode") explainations to accompany any code.
